0x08. Networking basics #1
Building upon the foundational knowledge introduced in the previous project (0x07 - Networking basics), this project delves deeper into networking basics, emphasizing essential concepts such as localhost (127.0.0.1), understanding 0.0.0.0, hosts file configurations (/etc/hosts), and network interface display using commands like ifconfig and netcat. Through exploration of these topics, you'll enhance your understanding of network configurations and communication. Each script is crafted to address distinct challenges, contributing to a comprehensive exploration of networking fundamentals.
